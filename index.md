***Prompts:***

**1) What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** </br>
I thought that the concept of rotary positional embedding was a really interesting way to handle embedding the nuances of positional information.

**2) Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** </br>
We haven't really settled on an exact topic, since I think that our mentor is going to tell us what to do, but I'm hoping it'll be somewhere in the econ/finance field, since that's what my coursework has been focused on.

**3) What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** </br>
I think I'd have liked a little more direction in what specifically our mentor wanted us to implement; while I'm a fan of working independently, sometimes it feels like what we're doing is decided on the spur of the moment. Maybe that's just me being too used to a classroom environment, though.

**4) What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** </br>
Honestly, I've got my hands full with trying to figure out what we're doing right now; I don't think I've got enough of a handle on our current techniques to try to foray into novel territory. Currently, I'd like to be able to properly implement sequence packing and flash attention into our model.
